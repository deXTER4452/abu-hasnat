      <h1>Let's get to know me</h1>

      <p>My name is Abu Hasnat. My friends call me Tushar, which is my nickname. </p>

       <p> I was born and raised in Dhaka which is the capital of Bangladesh. Set beside the Buriganga River, Dhaka is also known as the city of mosques with a population of more than 22million. Dhaka is the financial, commercial and the entertainment city of Bangladesh.</p>
        
       <p> I am the youngest one in the family with three siblings. With an elder brother and two sisters I am the pampered one. My father is a businessman, who takes care of our family partnering with my mother who is a housewife.</p>
        
       <p> Working in a well known department has always been a dream of mine and also my fatherâ€™s. I was always fascinated by the backend development of apps and websites which carried my curiosity till this far. </p>
        
        <p>Technology is ever changing. The current wave that caught my eye is a decentralized platform for the internet which is also known as Web3. My curiosity of learning new things led me to Web3. I would like to learn more about it and create something that would be revolutionary.</p>
        
       <p> I am very passionate about traveling.  Last year, I went on a by road solo trip and visited about 32 cities on the West side of Canada. </p>
        
      <p>I like to spend most of my free time playing video games. My favorite game is  Modern Warfare. On a free day I usually spend about 8 hours on it. Other than that I like to go out with friends and have a good time. </p>
